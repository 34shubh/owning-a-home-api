# Owning a Home API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cfpb/owning-a-home-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cfpb/owning-a-home-api)

This provides an API for the [Owning a Home project](https://github.com/cfpb/owning-a-home). The tool will return rates available on the market.
Note that it relies on bringing data from an external (not free) source.

**Status**

The API is at version 1.0, a work in progress.

**Dependencies**
 * [Django 1.6](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/)
 * [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org)
 * [Django localflavor](https://github.com/django/django-localflavor)
 * [MySQL Python](http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/)
 * [South](http://south.aeracode.org)
 * [django-cors-headers](https://github.com/ottoyiu/django-cors-headers)

## Installing and using

The tool is a Django module and can be installed and run inside a Django project.
Here's help for setting up a Django project and adding modules:
 - [Starting a project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/)
 - [Adding modules](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/django-admin/#startproject-projectname-destination)

Install the app (ideally in a virtual environment):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cfpb/owning-a-home-api
cd owning-a-home-api && pip install -e .
```

In your core Django application, add `ratechecker` to the INSTALLED_APPS.  For example:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS += (
    'rest_framework',
    'countylimits',
    'ratechecker',
    'south',
)
```

Also add the following urls to your core Django applicationâ€™s urls.py:
```python
    url(r'^oah-api/rates/', include('ratechecker.urls')),
    url(r'^oah-api/county/', include('countylimits.urls')),
```

##What the app does

Owning a Home API includes two Django apps:

####ratechecker
This app exposes a single API endpoint, `/oah-api/rates/rate-checker`, with the following parameters:

| Param name | Required | Default value | Acceptable values |
| ---------- |:--------:| -------------:| -----------------:|
| arm_type | No, unless rate_structure=arm | N/A | 3-1, 5-1, 7-1, 10-1 |
| institution | No | N/A | _any valid institution name_, for ex. PNC, WELLS, UNBK, etc.|
| io | No | 0 | |
| loan_amount | Yes | N/A | _any positive integer_ |
| loan_purpose | No | PURCH | PURCH, REFI |
| loan_term | Yes | N/A | 30, 15 |
| loan_type | Yes | N/A | JUMBO, CONF, AGENCY, FHA, VA, VA-HB, FHA-HB |
| lock | No | 60 | |
| ltv [*1](#1) | No | N/A | |
| maxfico | Yes | N/A | 0 -> 850 |
| minfico | Yes | N/A | 0 -> 850 |
| points | No | 0 | |
| price | Yes | N/A | _better be larger than loan_amount_ |
| property_type | No | SF | |
| rate_structure | Yes | N/A | FIXED, ARM |
| state | Yes | N/A | _all the US state's abbreviations_ |

[1]: We actually calculate its value and don't check the value sent in request

ratechecker will return a JSON object containing `data` and `timestamp`

ratechecker has a management command, `load_daily_data`, which loads daily interest rate data from CSV.

####countylimits
This app exposes a single API endpoint, `/oah-api/county`, which requires a `state` parameter for querying Federal Housing Administration loan lending limit, Government-Sponsored Enterprises mortgage loan limit and the Department of Veterans Affairs loan guaranty program limit for the counties in a given state.

countylimits will return a JSON object containing `state`, `county`, `complete_fips`, `gse_limit`, `fha_limit`, and `va_limit`.

countylimits has a management command, `load_county_limits`, which loads these limits from a CSV file provided in [`data/county_limit_data-flat.csv`](https://github.com/cfpb/owning-a-home-api/blob/master/data/county_limit_data-flat.csv)

## Testing
Testing requires mock, so you'll need to install that before running tests.


```shell
pip install mock
./manage.py test [ratechecker]
```
