## Notes on 2017 data

Loan limit values for 2017 had to be amended, because the spreadsheet provided included a county that no longer exists -- Shannon County, SD -- and was missing its successor.

The county was renamed "Oglala Lakota" on May 1, 2015, when it acquired a new FIPS number, 46102.

So in the file '2017_amended.csv,' the entry for Shannon County was replaced with an entry for Oglala Lakota, with its new FIPS and 2017 loan limit values.
